# 🧠 Profile Card Gallery – Flexbox & Grid Beginner Project

Welcome, mentees! 👋  
This is your very first layout project using **Flexbox** and **Grid**. You’ll build a “Profile Card Gallery” where cards are arranged side-by-side and in rows using CSS.

## 💡 First: What Is a Layout?

A layout is how things are arranged on a webpage. Just like how furniture is placed in a room, a layout is how **boxes (elements)** are arranged on the screen.

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent and Children Explained

In HTML and CSS, we describe elements as **parents** and **children**.

- The **parent** is like a big box (container) that holds smaller boxes.
- The **children** are the items inside that box.

📦 **Analogy**:  
Imagine a **bookshelf (parent)** holding **books (children)**.  
You can choose whether the books line up in a row, stack up, or fill a grid.

## 📦 What Is Flexbox?

**Flexbox** is a layout tool in CSS that helps you arrange items **in one direction** — either in a **row (left to right)** or a **column (top to bottom)**.

### When to Use It:

Use Flexbox when you want items to:

- Sit side-by-side in a row
- Stack on top of each other
- Wrap to the next line when there isn’t enough space
- Be centered easily

## 🗃️ What Is Grid?

**CSS Grid** lets you place items in both **rows and columns**. It gives you a **grid-like structure** similar to a spreadsheet.

### When to Use It:

Use Grid when you want:

- A table-like structure
- Multiple rows and columns
- Total control over item placement

## 🧱 Grid Properties Explained

## 🔍 The Main Difference

| Layout Tool         | Flexbox                                              | Grid                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Direction           | One-direction (row OR column)                        | Two-direction (rows AND columns) |
| Layout Type         | 1D layout                                            | 2D layout                        |
| Good for...         | Lining things up in a row or column (like a nav bar) | Creating full grids or galleries |
| Think of it like... | A row of books or a single stack of boxes            | A spreadsheet or chessboard      |

## 📘 Tips for Success

- Only Flexbox or Grid properties work after you write `display: flex` or `display: grid`.
- Use the **box of books** analogy to understand layout behavior.
- Practice by changing values and **see how things move**!
